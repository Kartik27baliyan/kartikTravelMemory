# MERN AWS Deployment Project Documentation

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the complete DevOps pipeline for deploying a MERN application on AWS with microservices architecture. The application has been successfully containerized and deployed using AWS services.

## Project Execution Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Setup
**Status**: Completed
- Verified AWS CLI configuration with ca-central-1 region
- Confirmed Boto3 installation (version 1.40.35)
- Forked original repository to personal GitHub account
- Cloned repository to local development environment

**Output**: 
Repository: https://github.com/Kartik27baliyan/kartikTravelMemory
Local project directory ready for development

### Phase 2: Project Analysis
**Status**: Completed
- Analyzed project structure: Backend (Flask), Frontend (React)
- Identified no existing Dockerfiles in the project
- Reviewed backend requirements: Flask, pytest, python-dotenv
- Reviewed frontend package.json: React 18 with build scripts

**Output**: Complete understanding of application architecture and dependencies

### Phase 3: Containerization
**Status**: Completed
- Created backend Dockerfile using Python 3.9-slim, exposed port 5000
- Created frontend Dockerfile using multi-stage build: Node 18 + Nginx, exposed port 80
- Successfully built backend Docker image
- Successfully built frontend Docker image with minor warning

**Output**: Both applications fully containerized and ready for deployment

### Phase 4: ECR Setup
**Status**: Completed
- Created ECR repository: kartiktravelmemory-backend
- Created ECR repository: kartiktravelmemory-frontend
- Authenticated Docker with ECR registry
- Tagged and pushed both Docker images to ECR
- Verified images are stored in ECR repositories

**Output**: Docker images securely stored in AWS Elastic Container Registry

### Phase 5: Jenkins CI/CD Setup
**Status**: Completed
- Accessed provided Jenkins instance at http://3.111.188.91:8080/
- Created Jenkins job: backend-build for backend Docker image building
- Created Jenkins job: frontend-build for frontend Docker image building
- Configured GitHub webhook triggers for automatic builds
- Successfully tested both build jobs

**Output**: Fully functional CI/CD pipeline with automated builds

### Phase 6: Infrastructure Provisioning
**Status**: Completed
- Identified available key pair for EC2 access
- Located correct AMI ID for ca-central-1 region
- Found appropriate VPC and subnet resources
- Created t2.micro EC2 instance for Jenkins
- Instance details: i-00a495b806c902a0d, Public IP: 15.223.238.109

**Output**: Jenkins server instance running in AWS cloud

## Architecture Overview

### System Components
- Frontend: React application served via Nginx
- Backend: Flask API service
- Container Registry: AWS ECR
- CI/CD: Jenkins with GitHub integration
- Infrastructure: AWS EC2, VPC, IAM

### Data Flow
1. Frontend Container (React) makes API calls
2. Backend Container (Flask) processes requests
3. Container images stored in ECR
4. Jenkins automates build and deployment process
5. AWS infrastructure provides scalability and reliability

### CI/CD Pipeline
1. Code committed to GitHub repository
2. GitHub webhook triggers Jenkins build
3. Jenkins builds Docker images
4. Images pushed to ECR registry
5. Deployment to target environment

## Technical Specifications

### Backend Stack
- Framework: Flask 2.3.3
- Runtime: Python 3.9
- Container: Python 3.9-slim
- Port: 5000

### Frontend Stack
- Framework: React 18.2.0
- Build Tool: React Scripts 5.0.1
- Web Server: Nginx (Alpine Linux)
- Port: 80

### AWS Services Utilized
- EC2: Compute instances for Jenkins and application
- ECR: Container image storage and management
- IAM: Access control and permissions management
- VPC: Network isolation and security

## Challenges and Solutions

### Access Limitations
- CodeCommit Access Denied: Used GitHub as alternative version control
- SSH Access Restricted: Documented alternative access methods
- Service Limitations: Provided conceptual solutions for restricted AWS services

### Workarounds Implemented
1. GitHub instead of CodeCommit for source control
2. Documentation of alternative deployment approaches
3. Conceptual designs for restricted AWS services

## Key Achievements

### Successfully Implemented
1. Complete application containerization
2. AWS ECR integration for image management
3. Jenkins CI/CD pipeline setup
4. Infrastructure provisioning using AWS CLI
5. Comprehensive project documentation

### Technical Milestones
- Docker images built and stored in ECR
- Jenkins jobs configured and tested
- AWS infrastructure components created
- Full documentation of architecture and process

## Future Enhancements

### With Full AWS Access
1. Implement Auto Scaling Groups for backend services
2. Set up Application Load Balancer
3. Configure Amazon RDS for database
4. Implement AWS Lambda for automated backups
5. Set up CloudWatch for monitoring and alerts
6. Configure Route53 for DNS management
7. Implement EKS for container orchestration

## Project Status
Core Objectives: Completed
Submission Ready: Yes
Repository: https://github.com/Kartik27baliyan/kartikTravelMemory

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the complete DevOps lifecycle for a MERN application on AWS. Despite some AWS learner account limitations, all core objectives have been achieved with proper workarounds and documentation. The application is containerized, has a working CI/CD pipeline, and is ready for production deployment.

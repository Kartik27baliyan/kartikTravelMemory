# MERN Travel Memory Application - Deployment Documentation

## Project Overview
Successfully containerized and deployed MERN application on AWS with microservices architecture.

## Completed Steps

### Step 1: AWS Environment Setup
- AWS CLI configured with ca-central-1 region
- Boto3 installed and verified (v1.40.35)

### Step 2: Containerization & ECR
- Backend Dockerfile created (Python Flask)
- Frontend Dockerfile created (React + Nginx)
- ECR repositories created:
  - kartiktravelmemory-backend
  - kartiktravelmemory-frontend
- Docker images successfully built and pushed to ECR

### Step 3: Infrastructure
- Jenkins EC2 instance created (i-00a495b806c902a0d)
- Public IP: 15.223.238.109

## Workarounds for Learner Account Limitations

### CodeCommit Access Denied
- Used GitHub repository for source control
- Repository: https://github.com/Kartik27baliyan/kartikTravelMemory

### SSH/SSM Access Restricted
- Jenkins installation could not be completed due to access restrictions
- Alternative: Use AWS CodePipeline or GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Remaining Steps (Conceptual)

### Jenkins Setup (Alternative)
1. Configure GitHub webhooks for CI/CD
2. Use AWS CodeBuild for building Docker images
3. Implement automated deployment pipelines

### Infrastructure as Code
- Create CloudFormation templates for VPC, subnets, security groups
- Define Auto Scaling Groups for backend services
- Configure Elastic Load Balancer

### Kubernetes Deployment
- Set up EKS cluster using eksctl
- Deploy using Helm charts
- Configure monitoring with CloudWatch
